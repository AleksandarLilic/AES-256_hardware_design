# Digital Design projects

## **AES-256**
**Description:**

VHDL hardware design of AES-256 encryption algorithm for ASIC or FPGA implementation

Done as a part of the Graduate thesis

AES is implemented as a two part design - *key schedule* and *encryption*. Both were separately functionally verified, and verified again when assembled. Project is then expanded with *data loading* block, which takes 128 bit ciphertext and sends it down a 8-bit bus in 16 packets. 

**Status:** &nbsp;

Basic functional verification done with all of the used vectors passing

**Further development:**

Self-checking testbench, more test cases, coverage


## **Spartan 3E development**
**Description:**

VHDL hardware design of various modules with FPGA implementation

Homework assignmets as a part of Digital systems design course

**Status:**

Finished
